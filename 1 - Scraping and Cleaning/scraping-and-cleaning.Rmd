# Data & Web Scrapers

### Introduction

Iâ€™ve been playing in a fantasy baseball league with some college friends for several years and have generally done pretty well. But in 2018, rather than doing normal preparation and research ahead of the draft, I decided to take a deeper dive and analyze some fantasy baseball data that I scraped from ESPN.


### Web Scrapers

For this project, I scraped data from ESPN and Baseball Reference. I'm not going to walkthrough the code, but scraping scripts can be found in my [github repo](https://github.com/jason-hanser/fantasy-baseball/tree/main/1%20-%20Scraping%20and%20Cleaning) if you are interested. 

NOTE: The scrapers were built in early-2018 and may not function properly today. 

### Data

Below is a summary of the raw and cleaned data that I collected. Within my [github repo](https://github.com/jason-hanser/fantasy-baseball/tree/main/1%20-%20Scraping%20and%20Cleaning), you can find the script I used to clean the data.
